# We bind github's DateTime scalar type to Go's time.Time (which conveniently
# already defines MarshalJSON and UnmarshalJSON).  This means genqlient will
# use time.Time when a query requests a DateTime, and is required for custom
# scalars.
bindings:
  DateTime:
    type: time.Time
  TimelessDate:
    type: time.Time
  JSONObject:
